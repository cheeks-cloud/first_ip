# first_ip
This is my first ip at moringa school.
To run the project you only need vs code and internet connection to download.
This project is aimed to teach on basic html and styling using css.
for the future i need to align the first image to left, set the first colour div so that it is not linear.i also need to put an image ontop of another.
the bugs are;use of alot of ids,and footer needs to be arranged.
